# ML-Model_Comparison

This repository contains the work I have done on various datasets till now and various Machine Learning models are built on top of all of these datasets.
In this Repository, there are separate folders for each dataset i have worked on and will be adding more as i continue my work on other datasets.
Each folder contains python scripts for various Machine Learning models with their accuracy scores and confusion matrix calculated.
All of these models employ Data Preprocessing and Cleaning according to my perception and understanding of the dataset and is open for improvisations by the community.All the hyperparameters if any, are tuned according to my experimentation for getting the maximum accuracy. Again, they are subject to improvisations.

The idea behind my work is to compare different ML models on a specific dataset so that it can help in model selection on the basis of various parameters in future.
